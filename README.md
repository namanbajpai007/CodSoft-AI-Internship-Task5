# CodSoft-AI-Internship-Task5
#TASK 5 - FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION  Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.  

*Here for working of FaceRecognition.py you have to run HaarcascodeFaceDetection.py first to generate the data set then Face recognition will work.
